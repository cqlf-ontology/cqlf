# Corpus Query Lingua Franca

This repository hosts the CQLF Ontology, which describes the expressive power of corpus query languages (CQLs) supported by conformance statements in the form of parameterised query expressions.

Based on the draft international standard ISO/DIS 24623-2:2020 (currently at DIS ballot stage), the ontology will be created, updated and extended in a community process driven together by CQL developers and end users.  This process is moderated by the GitHub organisation [CQLF Ontology](https://github.com/cqlf-ontology).

The repository contains the following files:

 - `CQLF-2.owl` is the master version of the community ontology. An initial ontology is currently in development and will be used to seed the community process later on.
 - `templates/CQLF-2.owl` is an RDF/XML serialisation of the normative part of ISO/DIS 24623-2:2020.
 - `examples/CQLF-2.owl` is a small illustrative example ontology, including the examples described in Annex A of the draft international standard.
